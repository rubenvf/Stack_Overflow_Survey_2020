# Stack Overflow Survey 2020
Code for project 1 UdacityÂ´s Data Scientist Nanodegree


## Installation
All the code has been written with Python 3 and all the necessary libraries are included in the Anaconda distribution.

## Project motivation
The goal of this project was to analyze the data from the 2020 Stack Overflow survey, which can be downloaded for free [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/?_ga=2.179256676.1992381700.1615479531-1434077162.1612892796). More specifically, I focused on creating a regression model to predict developer salaries. In addition, I was interested in answering the following questions:

- What have been the most used programming languages in 2020?

- How does the salary vary depending on the type of developer?

- How does job satisfaction vary depending on the type of developer?

## File Descriptions
There are two files:

- `SalaryRegression.ipynb`: Linear Regression for Predicting Developer Salaries. | [Preview](https://github.com/rubenvf/Stack_Overflow_Survey_2020/blob/main/SalaryRegression.ipynb)

- `DevType_Analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of the issues specified in the motivation of the project. | [Preview](https://github.com/rubenvf/Stack_Overflow_Survey_2020/blob/main/DevType_Analysis.ipynb)

## Results
The main findings of the analysis are available in [this](https://rubenvilela.medium.com/this-data-will-help-you-choose-your-developer-type-d4a92dff1568) Medium post.

As for linear regression, I have not been able to create a model that predicts more than 24% of the variability in salaries.
